# Galgje

This is an implementation of hangman game (named galgje in Dutch) created for my parents.
Originally (back in 1998) this was written  in Visual Basic 6 as a hobby project to learn VB (I was studying Applied Information Technology in Antwerp).


When VB became end-of-life  I rewrote it in Java and added an English option.
The English list was copied from https://github.com/Tom25/Hangman  (as I didn't want to read another dictionary).

This code is not actively maintained anymore, though I try to keep it compatible with newer JREs.
